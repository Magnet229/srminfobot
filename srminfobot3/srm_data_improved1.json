I applied only on 21.03.09 and in just four days i.e. on 25.03.09, I got it. I am amazed at the speed at which you responded and at the same time, I'm filled with pride and joy that my daughter graduated from your college.\n\nInitially, I was a bit apprehensive about her future, when I got her admitted in your college. I had some initial doubts, as after all SRM is a private institute. But the way the faculty and all people associated with your college shape the future of students - I am proud to declare that I have got my daughter educated in one of the best institutions in the country.\n\nShe got a placement in T.C.S. in third year, where her friends from I.I.T. also got placed. Now I have no regrets that she could not study in I.I.T., as S.R.M. was as good as I.I.T., if not better. It really is!\n\nAt present she is in Manchester (England) with her husband. She is seeking admission in an advanced course in Manchester University. S.R.M. has imbibed in her a strong zeal to study further and to excel in whatever pursuit she is in. Thanks a lot."

A high-performance computer (HPC) is a computer with a high-level computational capacity compared to a general-purpose computer. The performance of High-performance computers (HPC) is measured in floating-point operations per second (FLOPS) instead of million instructions per second (MIPS). In general thousands of dedicated processors are placed in proximity to each other (e.g. in a computer cluster); this saves considerable time moving data around and makes it possible for the processors to work together (rather than on separate tasks), for example in mesh and hypercube architectures. High-performance computers (HPC) are typically used for scientific and engineering applications that must handle very large databases or do a great amount of computation (or both)."
